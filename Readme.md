# Business Insight & Recommendation
1. There is a significant difference between total orders and total sales, and this can be tentatively attributed to inadequate inventory. This situation may cause inconvenience for customers when placing orders. Therefore, improvement is needed by evaluating products with higher or lower order volumes to achieve an optimal balance in inventory.

2. Analysis indicates that the majority of cafe customers are women. As a corrective strategy, innovation can be implemented by offering coffee with unique decorations, enhancing accessibility, and ensuring customer comfort as the primary focus.

3. It is found that the preferred size by customers, especially for the categories of coffee, chocolate drinks, and tea, is 16 oz, single for bakery, and 1.5 oz for special lattes. To enhance the bakery product offering, improvements can be made by providing dozen-sized options with various flavor variations.

4. There is a significant difference in the order volumes between Jakarta Selatan and Jakarta Barat, which may be influenced by differences in customer demographics, lifestyles, and trends. To enhance performance, it is recommended to adjust the cafe concept to align with the customer demographics in each city.

5. There are several product categories with low order volumes, necessitating stock adjustments. To address this situation, corrective measures can be taken, such as reducing stock for products with low orders and increasing stock for products with high orders.
